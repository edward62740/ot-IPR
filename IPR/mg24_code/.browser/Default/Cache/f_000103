For EmberZNet, Silicon Labs Thread and Flex Application Builder projects, this can be achieved by configuring the project to build for the \"Local Storage Bootloader\", and setting the macro INTERNAL_STORAGE_SIZE_KB to 668, reserving 668 kB for storage (i.e. everything from address 356 kB and up). For Bluetooth projects, the size of the application needs to be manually changed in the linker file.\nThe \"bootload info\" meta-information, which tells the bootloader which storage slot to install the next firmware update from, is configured under \"Components->Common Storage\" to be placed at address 0x59000 (356 kB). The first storage slot is configured to start at address 0x5A000 (360 kB), because the bootload info takes up 2 flash pages of 2 kB.\nSee UG489: Gecko Bootloader User's Guide to learn more about how to configure the bootloader, configure storage layout, enable security features, etc.\n"},{"imageURL":"bundleentry://1000.fwk478912506/icons/projectNew.svg","supportDocuments":[],"description":"This sample configuration of the Gecko bootloader configures the bootloader to use the internal main flash to store firmware update images.

The storage configuration is set up to store a single firmware update image at a time, in a single storage slot. The storage slot is configured to start at address 0x0 of the SPI flash, and have a size of 512 kB. This can be configured on the \"Storage\" tab.\nThis sample configuration works out-of-the-box with the default sample configuration of the Zigbee OTA Client in EmberZNet sample apps.\nNote: If support for multiple storage slots is desired, the start address of the storage, configurable under \"Software Components->Platform->Bootloader->Storage->Bootloader Storage Slot Setup\", *must* be configured to provide the location for \"bootload info\", which is meta-information about the storage slots to tell the bootloader which storage slot to install the next firmware update from. See the \"SPI Flash Storage Bootloader (multiple images)\" sample configuration for more information.\nSee UG489: Gecko Bootloader User's Guide to learn more about how to configure the bootloader, configure storage layout, enable security features, etc.\n"},{"imageURL":"bundleentry://1000.fwk478912506/icons/projectNew.svg","supportDocuments":["file:/C:/Users/Workstation/SimplicityStudio/SDKs/gecko_sdk/protocol/zigbee/app/framework/scenarios/zha/StandardizedRfTesting/readme.html"],"description":"This is a pre-standardization implementation of Zigbee's RF testing standard.
